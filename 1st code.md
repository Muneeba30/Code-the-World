    <p>Hello World! <br>
        what do you do?

    <pre>In a dream I spoke with the Cyprus-born,

        And said to her,
  
  “Mother of beauty, mother of joy,
  
  Why hast thou given to men
  
   
  
  “This thing called love, like the ache of a wound
  
        In beauty's side,
  
  To burn and throb and be quelled for an hour
  
  And never wholly depart?“</pre>
